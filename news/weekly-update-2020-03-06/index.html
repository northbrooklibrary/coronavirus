        <h1>Community Collaboration: March 6 Update on Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h1>
        <p class="news-article-meta">Posted on March 6, 2020</p>
        <p>As leaders in Glenview and Northbrook, together, we are strongly committed to protecting the health and well-being of all our communities. We formed the Glenview-Northbrook Coronavirus Task Force, made up of representatives from the municipalities, schools, township, park districts and libraries in our communities. Earlier this week, members met in both Glenview and Northbrook, and will come together regularly to share information and resources about the novel coronavirus, and the illness that it causes, COVID-19. The entities plan to take consistent and coordinated action whenever possible. </p>
        <p>We also are committed to providing accurate, timely and valuable information. To that end, expect to receive a joint weekly message each Friday for as long as there is concern about the novel coronavirus. A newly created web page (http://www.glenviewnorthbrookcoronavirus.info) will provide vetted information to help Glenview and Northbrook community members understand the facts and get answers to frequently asked questions. We will continue to update the page as necessary with more specific guidance in the event of confirmed cases in Northfield Township, and any protocols that our organizations and our communities as a whole will follow as a result. </p>
        <p>We ask that you keep the lines of communication open as well. Please reach out to your health care provider if you believe you have been exposed to the virus.</p>
        <p>We follow the guidance of the Cook County Department of Health, Illinois Department of Public Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the novel coronavirus. These sources confirm that as of this writing, there are no cases in our communities, and the risk of contracting the virus remains low. </p>
        <p>Here are a few details we would like to highlight at this time: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>The CDCâ€™s Travel Health Notices page as of today recommends a 14-day quarantine for individuals returning from China, Italy, Iran, and South Korea.</li>
        <li>We encourage you to practice healthy habits to reduce the spread of germs, including: </li>
        <li>Stay home if you are sick, and keep sick children home from school and other activities until they are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing drugs.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. </li>
        <li>If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol content and is not expired.</li>
        <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
        <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
        <li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
        <li>Do not share eating utensils or drinking containers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Monitoring the situation and responding to any changes will continue to be a strong, coordinated effort across Glenview and Northbrook.  </p>
